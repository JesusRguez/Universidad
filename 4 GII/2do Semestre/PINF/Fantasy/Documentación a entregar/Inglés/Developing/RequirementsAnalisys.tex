\chapter{Analisys of requirements}
\section{Agents catalogue}
Fantasy project agents catalogue will be the students who interact with de webpage.

These agents can be sorted in two groups: students and teachers.

\subsection{Teachers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Background:} They can open a window where you can select an image from the Internet, the computer or an image previously used. This image will cover all the workspace.
	\item \textbf{Active Point:} They can establish active points in the workspace and modify them conveniently by adding images, text, video, audio, etc. They can also establish a score for each active point of the fantasy to evaluate the students.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Students}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Background:} They can do the same as the teachers.
	\item \textbf{Active Point:} They can establish active points in the workspace and modify them conveniently by adding images, text, video, audio, etc. You can not set a score for active points.
\end{itemize}

\section{Characteristics of fantasies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item At the end of all active points there will be a button at the bottom right of ``\textbf{more information}'' and in the center there will be a new quiz that will be the final exam. This exam will have an independent score to all active points and will not have the statistical summary. If this quiz is repeated, the score would be updated with a percentage of the new score, plus the previous score with the objective that a student who repeats a quiz can not get the best grade due to repetition of it.
	\item The teachers can ask the students to make fantasies to learn as homework. These tasks can be done in groups of students based on two ideas:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Compulsory:} A student make fantasy and the rest search for additional information.
		\item \textbf{Optional:} Concurrent fantasy edition among all the members of the group.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Each fantasy will have a code to be shared.
	\item We will have two types of permissions in the fantasies: ``\textbf{see}'' and ``\textbf{see and edit}''.
	\item The platform will notify the teacher when the students have finished their respective jobs.
	\item The fantasies may be private, shared or public. By default, they will always be public and can be accesible by everyone who uses the platform.
	\item Shared fantasies can be accesible by other people with a password.
	\item Fantasies can be cloned.
\end{itemize}

\section{Characteristics of active points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It will be possible to move it within the background and modify its contents.
	\item If an image is added to the active point, that point is adapted to the shape of the image.
	\item You can also assign a video, which will open a window to play it, or an audio. In case there is no audio or video, the respective button will not be displayed.
	\item Active points may have background music that will be muted if the audio or video playback assigned to that point by the teacher begins. The music will be restored when the corresponding audio or video ends.
	\item The active points can be reorganized by the teachers and students so that they emerge in the desired order.
	\item Through the realization (not creation) of a fantasy, a student can not continue with the next active point without finishing the current one.
	\item The active points quiz should be fun and intuitive.
	\item There should be only three questions in each quiz of each active point and they should not be too difficult (multiple answer, simple answer, write a word).
	\item The quiz of the active point will appear on the screen when that active point is closed.
	\item Once the quiz is finished, the next active point appears in the order established by the teachers/students in the workspace.
	\item Each active point will have a score to add (to all) a maximum of 100 points.
	\item When assigning a score to an active point, it will be subtracted from the total (maximum 100 points). If an active point is eliminated, the general counter recovers the score assigned to that active point.
	\item The student does not know the total number of active points in the fantasy.
	\item When the student obtains a score by completing an active point, this amount is added to the global counter.
	\item Finally, we can have a statistical summary with the right/wrong questions of each active point.
	\item Only the score obtained will be saved the first time a quiz is done, then it can be done more times, but the note will not be recorded in the system.
	\item The student will have the option to save his progress with a save button manually or through the auto-save option.
