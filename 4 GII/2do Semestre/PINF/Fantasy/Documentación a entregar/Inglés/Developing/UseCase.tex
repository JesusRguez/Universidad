\section{Architecture design}
\subsection{Phisical architecture}
The phisical architecture used for the project development has been the computers from the team Fantasy members, which have worked as users as well as server.

Once the application is deployed and integrated with STIMEY project, the phisical architecture will be STIMEY servers.

\subsection{Logical architecture}
For logical architecture, we have used libraries and functionalities provided by Laravel framework and Javascript.

\subsection{Design architecture}
Both architectures previously mentioned join together in the view-controller model used in project Fantasy development. This provide many views from the clients side with their respective controller.

This makes that the application can be implemented litle by litle and with guarantee of functionality in every one of their steps.

\section{User interface desing}
The user interface design used in project Fantasy follows the rules of design of \href{https://stimey.eu/home}{STIMEY} both in the creation view and in the playing view of the fantasy.

We have reached an agreement with STIMEY project members so they give us the rules of stile and so we can make them resemble at the most, because the finality of the project is to integrate it in their plataform.

The performance of this interface will be regulated by the view-controller model used in their development.

\section{Data design}
Regarding data design, we have proposed the following diagram for the database of Fantasy project.

\section{Design of components}
The components used in the development of Fantasy project are: Laravel framework, MySQL and phpMyAdmin.

Thanks to this elements, we could incorporate the necesary views and controllers for the application functioning.

\section{Parameterization of the base software}
